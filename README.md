# UNICORN II Voice Assistant For Business Application

## Overview

This voice assistant is made to answer customer queries, decrease customer support ticket volume, and increase overall customer satisfaction. It does this by using an interactive and intuitive voice assistant that lives on the target website. When a user starts talking to the assistant a trained assistant will be able to search a vector database with semantic searching, primarily by using embeddings (numerical representation of words). When relevant context is fetched, the assistant will change context information and modify it to match the question asked. Feel free to try it out!

## Core Features
- Basically infinite data training on overcoming the traditional token limits present on most generative AI models. 
- Advanced Q & A functionality with the user.
- Voice powered assistance (89.4% WER), with automatic recognititon of a full 'utterance' as well as automatic muting when an utterance is being sent to the server, and when the widget is closed.
- Each message is appended to the next, giving it conversational memory, with full context on the current instance.

## Implementation Steps
Necessary steps to get the assistant working

1. **Signing In:** The business/organisation must sign into and purchase a relevant plan. For testing purposes plug in 424242... in place of the credit card details.
2. **Training Process:** Input information that will train the assistant. Q: A: formats work pretty well, but it can take various text-based input. 
3. **Integration with Website:** A code snippet will be generated on the website under the form, copy and paste into the HTML body. 

## Customer usage instructions
Usage instructions for the customers of the business who has already implemented the steps above.

- **Enabling Microphone:** To increase privacy, Chrome will automatically ask for Microphone Usage on the top left. Click allow access.
- **Ask away!** You can ask the assistant now any question related to the trained data. It will automatically find the relevant information and output its response above the widget container. 

## Troubleshooting
Issues you may encounter

- **Denied access:** If you accidently denied access to microphone, simply go to the top left next to the website URL, and click site settings. Either allow access, or set to default if you want the website to ask again.
